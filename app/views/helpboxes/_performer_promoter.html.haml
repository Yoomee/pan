  %li
    -if performer.tours
      =link_to("View all their tours", performer_tours_path(performer)+"#future" )
  -if performer.current_tour
    %li
      =link_to "Book a date", "#", :data => {:scroll => "#calendar"}
  %li
    =link_to "Add a review", new_performer_review_path(performer)
  %li  
    =link_to "Post a message on their wall", "#", :data => {:scroll => "#wall"}
%p
  Alternatively you could:   
%ul
  %li
    =link_to "View all other performers", performers_path 
  %li
    =link_to("View my own organisation", current_user.promoter)
