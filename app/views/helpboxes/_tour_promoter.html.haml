  This is a performer's tour page. As a promoter you can:
%ul
  %li
    -if tour.performer.tours
      =link_to("View all their tours", performer_tours_path(tour.performer)+"#all" )
  %li
    =link_to "Book a date", "#", :data => {:scroll => "#calendar"}
  %li
    =link_to "Add a review", new_tour_review_path(tour)
  %li  
    =link_to "Post a message on the performer's wall", performer_path(tour.performer) + "#wall"
%p
  Alternatively you could:   
%ul
  %li
    =link_to "View all other performers", performers_path 
  %li
    =link_to("View my own organisation", current_user.promoter)
