        We are currently in beta - which means we've released our online platform before it's finished. Why did we do that? There's a very simple answer: we want to get feedback from promoters during the development process rather than afterwards.   
      %p
        As the first users of the site your feedback is crucial to help us develop all the features of Tourbook.
        So don't be shy - have an explore and please use the feedback button at the foot of the page to tell us what you think.
