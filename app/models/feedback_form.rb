  intro "We are currently in beta - which means we've released our new online community before it's finished. Why did we do that? There's a very simple answer: we want to get feedback from you, the community, during the development process rather than afterwards.<br /><br />And we sincerely appreciate your constructive comments! So don't be shy, use the form below and tell us what you think! Then we'll build our new online platform together."
